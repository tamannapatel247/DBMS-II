CREATE TABLE Person (
    PersonID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    PersonName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Salary DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
    JoiningDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
    City VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Age INT NULL,
    BirthDate DATETIME NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE PersonLog (
    PLogID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    PersonID INT NOT NULL,
    PersonName VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,
    Operation VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    UpdateDate DATETIME NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE PersonLog (
    PLogID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    PersonID INT NOT NULL,
    PersonName VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,
    Operation VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    UpdateDate DATETIME NOT NULL
);

Part – A

1. Create a trigger that fires on INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operation on the Person table to display a
message “Record is Affected.”
2. Create a trigger that fires on INSERT operation on the Person table to convert person name into
uppercase whenever the record is inserted.
3. Create an INSERT trigger on person table, which calculates the age and update that age in Person table.

Part – B

4. Create a trigger that fires on INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operation on the Person table. For that,
create a new table PersonLog to log (enter) all operations performed on the person table.
5. Create an INSTEAD OF trigger that fires on INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operation on the Person table.
For that, log all operations performed on the person table into PersonLog.

Part – C

6. Create DELETE trigger on PersonLog table, when we delete any record of PersonLog table it prints
